      title: "Commercial Spaceflight: Humanity's Next Steps",
      text:
        'With a growing population, it has become challenging to environmentally sustain our way of living as our unhealthy consumption of resources has begun to concern our future habitability on this planet. As a possible solution, humanity’s curiosity has sparked the recent relevance of the commercial spaceflight industry — and its significant, billion-dollar entities that have been at the forefront of astronomy-related current affairs, such as Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and, of course, NASA. In preparation for Tomorrow, it is important we educate ourselves on the cosmos and this lucrative industry to appease our climate crisis, explore the unknown, find our rightful place in the universe, and discover the possibilities of space colonization utilizing commercial spaceflight and technological innovation. This raises the question: Is it worth abandoning societies we have spent generations building and restoring for the exploration and the colonization of outer space? As our planet suffers, is it feasible to potentially resort to space to ensure a brighter future? What is the true value in commercially exploring our solar system? ',

        'Following the year’s theme, 2020 has brought ample change and discussion in regards to the social climate of the world. From the awakening of protest and policy reform demand after the police killings of George Floyd or Breonna Taylor, humanity has been encouraged to reevaluate its own merits and seek improvement. In the social justice plenary, students will learn more about the history of anti-black racism, understand the current landscape of social injustice today, and investigate a brighter future. Notably, the plenary’s speakers will use their expertise in mental health to help listeners understand the importance of better appreciating themselves, and show how doing so can, in turn, help us respect others too.',
