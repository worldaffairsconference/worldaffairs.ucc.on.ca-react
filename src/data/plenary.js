      text:
        'With a growing population, it has become challenging to environmentally sustain our way of living as our unhealthy consumption of resources has begun to concern our future habitability on this planet. As a possible solution, humanity’s curiosity has sparked the recent relevance of the commercial spaceflight industry — and its significant, billion-dollar entities that have been at the forefront of astronomy-related current affairs, such as Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and, of course, NASA. In preparation for Tomorrow, it is important we educate ourselves on the cosmos and this lucrative industry to appease our climate crisis, explore the unknown, find our rightful place in the universe, and discover the possibilities of space colonization utilizing commercial spaceflight and technological innovation. This raises the question: Is it worth abandoning societies we have spent generations building and restoring for the exploration and the colonization of outer space? As our planet suffers, is it feasible to potentially resort to space to ensure a brighter future? What is the true value in commercially exploring our solar system? ',

While benefiting our world by constructing a network of seemingly endless connectivity, it has also caused immense consequences to society as a whole. From the discussion of user manipulation, personal security and privacy, fake news and conspiracy, to human products, social media is reprogramming the way our world functions. Tech conglomerates such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter are at the forefront of the new age of exploitation, playing a pivotal role in potential human detriment. So, we must keep the conversation going. If we are the product, what does this mean for civilization? What does the future of social media entail? What are the consequences? ',

Carroll was featured in the 2019 Netflix documentary, The Great Hack, which exposed the dark side of social media and big data by exploring the behind the scenes of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Cambridge Analytica, a UK based consulting company, was able to influence the 2016 US Presidential Election by harvesting data from millions of American voters for political advertising. The film detailed Carroll’s data quest to legally challenge the company and recover his own personal data which received international attention. Carrol’s goal was to not only reclaim his data profile, but to also discover whether or not this exploitation of data was threatening democracy itself. ',
